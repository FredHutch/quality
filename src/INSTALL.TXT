QUALITY Install Notes

Due to licensing restrictions, we are unable to supply the Numerical Recipes
source code used to generate the P-value--if you want that feature, you will
need to provide your own licensed copy of the Numerical Recipes sources. We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the hopes of making it easier for you to generate the appropriate program
version, we have supplied two makefiles: "Makefile" for a basic build, and
"Makefile.nr" to build the "P-value-enabled" version.

* Makefile

For the most part, you should be able to just type 'make' at the command line,
and the non-Numerical Recipes version of QUALITY will be built as 'quality'.
If there are problems, please examine the makefile and change the settings as
appropriate for your system.

* Makefile.nr

If you are supplying a copy of the Numerical Recipes sources, edit Makefile.nr
as necessary. Hopefully, you should only need to change the parameters that
relate to the location of the Recipes. Save the changes, then type
'makefile -f Makefile.nr' to build the "P-value-enabled" version using
"Makefile.nr" rather than "Makefile".

I am definitely not a Makefile guru. If anyone has feedback on how to
simplify this setup, yet keep it easy for non-gurus to install, I'd like to
hear it.

Once successfully compiled, please compare the results you obtain using
the included sample input file ("QUALITY_sample_data" or "TESTPC.TXT",
depending on the download) against our results in "ANSWERS.TXT". If they
do not match, check that the endline character(s) of the input file is
correct for your platform. If that's okay, something is wrong in the
compilation, and we do not recommend you rely on the resulting program
for dependable results.
